        <h1> Welcome To Detroit! </h1>
        <hr width="350px">
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"></pstyle> Detroit is a spirited town with an embracing personality for its residents. It holds a lot of firsts. A looot of firsts.
        The first paved road, first individually assigned phone numbers, first state fair and even the first place an automatic 
        coffee maker was ever used. All things that supplement an "on the go" lifestyle. Detroit has always been home to some truly 
        innovative thinkers, and it still is! <br> 
        
       <br> However, residents say that although they love living in Detroit, the rising cost of living,
         needs to come with improvements to public transit and public services, as well as a stronger job market. 
        Detroit still has one of the weakest public transit systems of any major city, and Detroiters are eager 
        for that to change. According to Michigan Advance, Detroit is "widely regarded as one of the nation's worst public transit systems, where
        Detroit relies on "two unconnected and inadequate bus systems" that serve more than 4 million residents." <a href = "https://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/documents/conference/2019/161.Sutcliffe-Cipkar.pdf" target = "_self">Supported Study</a><br>
        
        <br>A quote from a current resider: <br>
        
        <div class="border-box"></div>
        <blockquote>
            <q>
                I'm hoping that in the future, I can easily live in Detroit without a car â€” 
                 and I hope that's the case for many residents,...<br>
                 While I use my car less and less, the public transportation options are still 
                not sufficient to totally replace having my own vehicle. 
            </q>
            <p>&mdash; --Reardon (current Detroiter)</p>
          </blockquote>
        
         
         <p style="margin-left: 30px;"></pstyle> Cost of living needs to equate to its worthability. Is it worth it to reside in a costly area with insufficient means to 
         get around with ease? In addition to, a county that has the highest car crash rates in all of Michigan (Wayne county = over 50,000 car crashes a year: contributing to 20% of the state's total). <a href = "https://www.michigan.gov/msp/-/media/Project/Websites/msp/cjic/Traffic-Crash-Reporting-Unit-Files/YE-2021-FINAL.pdf?rev=b4171a384a9249c2be03abe0607abe68&hash=DCA2BDBE469FED696F120716529B94EE" target = "_self">Supported Study</a><br>
        
         <br>Short answer...<b>NO</b>...at least not enough.<br>
         <br>Coming from a consumer standpoint, there needs to be incentives. There needs to be a stimulus on both ends for the 
         consumer (residers/Detroiters) and suppliers (city councilman, builders and land developers). <b>"All walkable property types have the potential to generate returns as good as or better than less walkable properties,
          ...Developers should be willing to develop more walkable properties."</b> 
         <a href = "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00296.x" target = "_self">Supported Study</a> Especially if the bottom line is <b>"Money Talks"</b>...and for our case <b>"Money walks."</b> It is a profit to be made all around. Increasing the well-being 
         of your Detroiters while increasing the economic health staus of the city where profits to be made are well more in your grasp than not, is a win-win. In addition, to the profitable tax revenue and personal profitable revenue 
         is a treasure worth reaching for.

       <h5> <b>Problem:</b> </h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"></pstyle> 
        Detroit IS walkable in certain areas, but DISCONNECTS and becomes LESS walkable 
        sporadically throughout the city, which leaves GAPS in opportunities for TAX REVENUE for the city AND FINANCIAL GAINS for land developers. 
        Within these less walkable neighborhoods, there are also a lack of activites to engage in. This negatively impacts 
        population density on realms of residential, employment, office and retail space. All which that have a direct correlation to 
        improving walkability thus, improving economic status of the city. <br>

    The black borderline is the whole city of Detroit / Wayne county. The areas surrounding are light blue, yellow and blue. These colors show the lack of 
    walkability or pedestrian friendly areas in the city. The data was pulled and the map was created using data from the data catalog from  U.S.

                    The four cities chosen to compare  are Detroit with a walkable score of 65/100, Cleveland (75/100 walk score), Baltimore (64/100 walk score), and Boston (99/100 walk score). 
                    Per these interactive graphs above, they showcase the similarities and contrast between the average of means of transportation taken per population on thier way to work. As you can see, in each city, the highest mean 
                    of transportation is "driving alone" where the lowest is walking and biking. As the means of transportation equates to thier walkability score, Boston with the highest walkable
                    score has the highest means of transportation via walking and biking due to thier quality of a walkable town. Now Boston's car crash average is 4,432 a year, where as Baltimore is 17,888, Cleveland is 9,200 and Detroit is >50,000. 
                    Understnading these statistics in conjuction with this data, it butresses the fact that increasing the walkability of a location, increase the average  of walking within that particular city, which in turns has a positive impact on increasing public transit use 
                    along with bicycle use all while decreasing total amount of car crashes per year in a highly populated city. While the Worked at Home category may skew the results for Baltimore and Boston, we can still see that public transport,
                    bicycle, and walked are higher for those two cities.
                    <h4>Why is this important to understand?</h4>

                    This pie chart shows the tax sources for Wayne County (Detroit). It highlights the importance of increasing property values, which currently 
                    are one of the worst in the nation. If Detroit can create a denser, higher value city it should be able to increase overall tax revenues in 
                    coming years, enabling it to overcome the decades long tax revenue freefall that has previously occurred.

            For the visualization above, it is comparing Employment Density and Walk Index. 
             It is noted that the regression line is slightly higher.This indicates 
             that as employment density increases, the walk index increases even moreso. Which boost economic activity
             thus, promotes a higher demand in occupancy use and land use. This opening eases the bridge for land developers and builders to swoop in 
             and develop positive magic that lands money not only in the cities pockets, but theres'. The max capital gain for income in 
             Detroit is 15-20%. The average population is about 632,000 with about 3 people per household. Creating about 1.07 billion dollars in 
             opportunistic revenue that supports both parties; the consumer (Detroiters) and the investors (land developers, builders and city councilmen)

            The relationship between Office Density and Walk Index, we can see the regression line continuing 
            to rise from the previous visualization, showing that as office density increases, walk index more 
            often than not will go also increase. High walkability cities like Boston, New York, San Francisco, 
            and Washington DC all have higher residential, employment and office density values that correlate 
            to high walkability.

        <p>
            In this visualization we are analyzing the relationship between Walk index and Residential Density, 
            we can see clearly that as residential density goes up that walk index tends to increase quite a bit as well. 
            Which is great due to Detroits' homes values have increased to an average of 20% in 2022; 
            Individual tax increases capped at 5% (the best cap rate is between 5-10%) still offering appropiate risk and <b>GREAT</b> return.

        In our Bar graph, we have walk index and gross activity density which is housing units plus employment density on our bar graph, 
        with the y axis values being sorted by Office Density to demonstrate a correlation between these three values. As you can see the 
        high walkability cities in our dataset are mostly at the top, with New York, Boston, San Francisco, and Washington DC all showing 
        high walk index, gross activity density, and Office Density.

        The graph shows thereâ€™s really no correlation between the counties National Walk index and their average temperatures as
Wayne County has the lowest score, but is the warmest in terms of average temperature out the four counties. The information proved 
by the seaborne heat map lets us see it is more so how accessible walking is based on the cities infrastructure and temperature plays literally affect.

        The graph shows the comparison of all the counties used for walkability. The comparison is based off of the Total Population for each county.
         This clearly shows why we chose to compare to Detroit to the other cities because of how similar they are. We used the NWI, 
        Households Occupied, Workers, Total Employment & the Census Tract over the Total Population.

        In this visualization, we are comparing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington DC, 
        which all have a high walkability score along with a high GDP, as well as Detroit. Thriving Industry exists in each of the four 
        high walkability cities that are shown here. For example, in Chicago, you have a major economic hub, New York is a mecca of entertainment, 
        tech and finance. In Washington DC, our country's capital, you have a thriving economy driven by the private sector, there are many government 
        agencies, think tanks, as well as law firms which contribute to the city's high GDP. San Francisco is the home to a thriving tech industry, 
        and is also driven by the success and attraction of Silicon Valley. Detroit has the lowest GDP among all these cities, this could be attributed 
        to things like the decline of the auto industry, job loss, population decline, etc. This is why increasing walkability significantly and hopefully 
        increasing the city's GDP in the long run is so important to us, Detroit is a historic city that deserves and has the potential to be a hub and walkable 
        destination in it's own right.
