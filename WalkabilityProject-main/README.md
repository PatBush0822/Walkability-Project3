# WalkabilityProject



Detroit is walkable in certain areas, but disconnects and becomes less walkable sporadically throughout the city, there are also a lack of things to do in general including outside attractions that increase walkability like parks and such.
Our goal is to provide guidance and insights to potential investors and business owners on where to focus their efforts and resources in Detroit, but also to connect the city, and to make Detroit and the downtown area a destination for things to do, an attractive location to hold events like the Final Four, Bowl Games, Concerts, Music Festivals, Super Bowl, and other attractions that will bring a massive amount of new revenue to the city and help create a bustling tourist hub in Detroit. If Detroit can achieve these goals, increased spending by large events, entertainment areas, higher potential population and will generate higher tax revenues which can then be reinvested into the city for future endeavors.
We want and feel that the city needs to be more walkable in order to bring more people in and transform Detroit into a more attractive destination for tourists, events, and also young professionals looking to build a life in a big city. Lower density between attractions and destinations within the city will make it more walkable, create more things for locals and tourists to enjoy the city of Detroit by foot or bike. Pedestrian-friendly areas also tend to attract a variety of businesses, including small shops and restaurants, which can help to revitalize local economies.
